				<h2>design</h2>
				<aside class="notes">
				The initial concept and design of this device was revolutionary for the time of its inception, 
				it was the first body mounted device attempt to be created for gaming consoles or even computers themselves, 
				the power glove leapt headfirst into the field of wearable controllers and boldly stated that it was the device of the future, it was clearly designed as futuristic looking piece of technology, this intentional aesthetic choice made the device into a head turner and anyone within viewing range upon seeing it for the first time would understandably have to inquire as to the function of the device which  was likely a sales tactic

				<h2>technology</h2>
				<aside class="notes">
				The Power Glove is based on the patented technology of the VPL Dataglove (the original power glove), but with many modifications that allow it to be used with modestly performing consumer hardware and sold at an affordable price. Whereas the Dataglove can detect yaw, pitch and roll, uses fiberoptic sensors to detect finger flexure, and has a resolution of 256 positions (8 bits) per finger for four fingers, the Power Glove can only detect roll, and uses sensors coated with conductive ink yielding a resolution of four positions (2 bits) per finger for four fingers.
