Hi, My name is Connell Oliver I am a second-year student at Brock University. I am currently enrolled in the Interactive Arts and Science program and currently intend to complete the four-year honors degree. I am pursuing a specialization in the area of Geospatial Analysis. While much of the work I have performed in this class does not directly relate to this specialization it is noteworthy that throughout this document it should be noted the attention to patterning as well as general essential skills within this discipline will be evident within this portfolio. I intend on pursuing further involvement within the digital humanities and to complete a masters and culminate in a PhD within the digital humanities, at which point becoming a professor at an institution. At that point I will climb the ladder within the facultyâ€™s hierarchy and become the president of that institution. At this stage of my work I would use the large resources at my disposal to influence both business and political organizations and individuals applying both my knowledge of digital technology and politics to influence the masses and the elite, this will clearly lead to my career progression as the puppet master of the world and is reasonably achievable career pathway within the digital humanities based upon my skills and abilities.
